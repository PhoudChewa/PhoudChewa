Origin Story:
They say love at first sight doesn't exist, but my taste buds tell a different tale. It all began September 18, 1973. It was a damp autumn evening, and a neon sign illuminated the sidewalk. The wind's whisper ran through the trees as a savory aroma beckoned me. I followed, and I was led to the welcoming doors of a local restaurant. As I entered, my disposition quivered. Little did I know, the contents of my plate would fill the hole in my heart and become my life's bride. From that moment forward, I knew what I was born to do, and the rest is history. You never know what muddy clam might yield the greatest of pearls.
